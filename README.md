## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While this project was relatively easy, it became obvious that pre-planning the css grid is essential to avoid conflicts down the road.

In summary, while I started with a mobile-first template, when came the time to implement the css grid for the desktop version, the div and classes I had created brought more problems than they solved. I simplified all sections but will pay particular attention to this issue in the future.
